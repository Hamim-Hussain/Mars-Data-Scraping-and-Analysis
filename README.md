# Mars Data Scraping and Analysis

## Introduction
Embarking on Mars data exploration! Using Jupyter Notebooks, I'll scrape Mars news and weather details. Firstly, I'll extract titles and preview text from the Mars News site using Beautiful Soup. Then, I'll dive into Mars weather data, analysing temperatures, atmospheric pressure, and more. Excited to uncover insights from Mars-related sources and deepen my web scraping skills! Let's start this Martian adventure!
